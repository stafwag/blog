Size matters, but ... resolution and image quality are as import.

Since I was diagnosed with diabetes I have eyes issues things are getting better recently but I still needs glasses for reading etc. 

My "no smoking" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piggy_bank">Piggy Bank</a> was fat enough for some "eye candy". I bought a <a href="http://accessories.ap.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=au&cs=audhs1&l=en&redirect=1&s=dhs&sku=210-40773">Dell UltraSharp U2713HM</a> a 27 inch WQHD (2560x1440) IPS display.

Compared to the others screens I used to work with the image quality is amazing and the higher resolution give so much more space.
