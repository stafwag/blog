The [CGIpaf project](http://www.wagemakers.be/english/programs/cgipaf) has a new home at [GNU savannah](https://savannah.gnu.org/): [https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/cgipaf/](https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/cgipaf/)

The source code was - and is still also hosted - on GitHub.

There are a few reasons for the move;
* I was looking for an easy way to store binary releases. Binary releases aren't supported by GitHub.
  There might be a solution for this at [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com) but [scp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy) to upload a release is more convenient.
* [GitHub](https://www.github.com) is becoming too dominant.
* I prefer a solution that is based on [Free Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software).
* I was already using [GNU savannah](https://savannah.gnu.org/) for another project [lookat](http://www.wagemakers.be/english/programs/lookat).

***Have fun***
