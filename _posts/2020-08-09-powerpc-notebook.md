# PowerPC Notebook

<a href="https://www.powerpc-notebook.org/campaigns/donation-campaign-for-pcb-design-of-the-powerpc-notebook-motherboard/"><img src="{{ '/images/donate_powerpc_notebook2.png' | remove_first:'/' | absolute_url }}" class="right" width="680" height="385" alt="powerpc noetbook" /> </a>

I prefer [RISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer) as a CPU architecture over [CISC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer). RISC is a simpler design that should deliver more CPU performance with fewer transistors and is more power-efficient. We have to recognize that Intel and AMD have made great progress in increasing the performance and efficiency of the x86 CISC architecture.

But the [x86 architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86) comes with a FreeDOM cost, Intel has the [Intel Management Engine](Intel Management Engine) and closed [Proprietary software](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) is required to initialize the components. The same can be said about AMD; AMD has the [AMD Platform Security Processor]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Platform_Security_Processor) and binary [blobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object) are required.

[Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenPOWER_Foundation#Power_Architecture) is currently the most powerful alternative that doesn't require binary blobs; this is not only great for free/open source activists. A truly open-source firmware that can be reviewed / audited is also for nice security reasons.

For these reasons; I support the PowerPC notebook initiative: [https://www.powerpc-notebook.org](https://www.powerpc-notebook.org/). This project tries to design an open-hardware PowerPC notebook, the schematics are already completed and available at GitLab: [https://gitlab.com/power-progress-community/oshw-powerpc-notebook/powerpc-laptop-mobo](https://gitlab.com/power-progress-community/oshw-powerpc-notebook/powerpc-laptop-mobo).

There is a donation campaign running by the [project](https://www.powerprogress.org/) to complete the PCB design at: [https://www.powerpc-notebook.org/campaigns/donation-campaign-for-pcb-design-of-the-powerpc-notebook-motherboard/](https://www.powerpc-notebook.org/campaigns/donation-campaign-for-pcb-design-of-the-powerpc-notebook-motherboard/).

If this project interest you, you might consider donating to it.

***Have fun!***
