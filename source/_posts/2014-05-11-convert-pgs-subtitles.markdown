I own a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WD_TV">western digital tv live 1st generation</a> the user interface is a bit slow but it's still a nice media player.

Unfortunately it's unable to display PGS (blu-ray) subtitles.


<br />&nbsp;<br />

I created a shell scripts (converPgsSub.sh) to convert the subtitles a mkv file so it's possible to play it on my 5 year old wdlive.


convertPgsSub 1.0.0stable1 is available github:
