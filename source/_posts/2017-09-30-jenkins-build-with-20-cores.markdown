I finally got the time to try out my jenkins build on my new <a href="/blog/blog/2017/09/16/20-core-dual-processor-jenkins-build-workstation/">20 Core Dual Processor Jenkins Build Workstation</a>

{% youtube BNn9absXkE8 %}

I'm able to run all test on multiple operation systems now. I still need to review this setup and perhaps move some tests to <a href="https://www.docker.io">docker</a> instead of the virtual machines to save some memory. ...but this jenkins setup was configured before docker was a thing.

***Have fun***
