Finaly a long overdue release of Lookat / Bekijk the userfriendly file browser.

The new stable version 1.4.2 is available at the <a href="http://www.wagemakers.be/english/programs/lookat">http://www.wagemakers.be/english/programs/lookat"</a> 

Or at the <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> repository at GNU savannah <a href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/lookat.git">http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/lookat.git</a>


1.4.2 is a maintenance release. When there are more than 24 hours in a day I'll start with the long waited utf-8 support ;-)
