{% img right /images/rip_pluto.jpg 300 375 "RIP pluto" %} 
After 10 year, my fileserver pluto died.
Pluto was a AMD64 had 1GB RAM and 4 too loud samsung drives (160GB).


( 1 minute silence .... )
<br />
<br />

I take backups of course ;-)
I already ordered the parts to build a new pluto.


Pluto still hosted some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System">CSV</a> repositorties like <a href="http://www.wagemakers.be/english/programs/cgipaf">CGIpaf</a>.
But it's time to move the source to a safer place. This will be <a href="http://www.github.com">github</a>.  

I also decided to create a blog and I wanted something that integrated well with github. <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>  seems to be the most logical choose. It's written in ruby which is a nice bonus.
